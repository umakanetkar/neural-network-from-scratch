Neural Networks are the reason behind the AI boom happening right now. They are mathematical abstraction of human brain and are a powerful tool for solving a wide range of real-world problems in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.

The human brain has 3 parts: cortex(for short term memory), the hippocampus (to remember stuff like wheres the elevator) and the synapses.

In this notebook I am building a simple neural network with 2 layers on the famous MNIST dataset. (MNIST dataset was first used by Yann LeCun when he founded the CNN in 1989)
